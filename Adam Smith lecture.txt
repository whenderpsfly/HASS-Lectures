Economics: A Social Scientific Discipline that uses scientific methods to study the activities and behaviors of individuals, instituitions, and organizations as they relate to the production, ownership, and exchange of goods, resources, or services.

Actually Adam Smith is a moral philosopher. not an economist.

Etymology: 
Political -> Pertaining to Citizens polis:the city/state
Economy -> from oikos and nomos (house & laws)
Feudalism > [Semi] Industrial Production

Mercantilism: Dominant in Europe from 16~18th Centuries;
National wealth = accumulation of "Stock" [Gold, Silver, Tradeable Goods];
Goal: Favorable "Balance of Trade" [High Exports, Low Imports]
Managed through strict Government regulation [High Tariffs and Laws of Trade for Colonies]
State-Protected Monopolies
Zero-Sum Game of International Trade [Winners/Losers]

Purpose of Wealth of Nations (WON): Critique of Mercantilist Philosophy

Shift in Definition of Wealth
Mercantilist: Wealth = Money
Smith: Wealth = Productive Labor [Expansion]

What makes labor more productive?
1) Increase in 'Skill, Dexterity, and Judgement' of the Worker [Specialization]
2) Increase in proportion of those Employed in useful labor vs not [Workforce]
Above All: The Division of Labor

Workers IMPROVE, LOSE LESS TIME, INNOVATE.

Consequences: No longer produce own necessities;
Mutual dependence on [the products of] others' labour
Thus, must freely cooperate in a process of exchange [The Market]

Self-Interest and "The Invisible Hand"
Buying products we need or want "naturally" redistributes wealth and improves general wellbeing.
>Self-interest has unintended social benefits

The Natural Propensity to Exchange

"Laissez Faire" - Leave it alone!
By controlling and limiting trade, Govt. hinders productivity and decrease "general opulence" or wellbeing [Per Smith]
Free markets are those most in Conformity with "Natural Liberty"

Does self-interest = selfishness?
Are humans purely rational utility calculating machines?
Is there a place for Morality in Commercial Exchange [for Smith]?

What does it mean to be virtuous/good?
How do we know we are good?
Is "human nature" Altruistic or Egoistic? Both?

Reason is a Slave to the passions -Hume
