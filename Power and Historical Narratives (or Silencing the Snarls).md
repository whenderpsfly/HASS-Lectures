# Power and Historical Narratives (or Silencing the Snarls)

+ Human beings participate in history both as actors and narrators.

## Event

1) What happened

2) What is said to have happened

"I want to reject both the naive propositions that we are prisoners of our pasts and the pernicious suggestion that history is whatever we make of it." (Trouillot, Haitian Anthropologist)

Historiography is the history of writing history. 

Positivist view dominated Western scholarship.

Since the 1970s, a contructivist view has become more prevalent.

#### Fact & Fiction (Drawings with non-linear time)

+ We accept that there are rules that separate fact from fiction. There is a need for a special or different kind of credibility. 

+ But are these rules found? In language? Does a culture that did not have an ancient grammar book not have rules then? Does this mean their version of history is suspicious?

  All cultures, regardless of language, grammar, have a way of evaluating fact from fiction.

  + The boundary between what happened and what is said to have happened is necessary. (p.13)

The past is shaped by the present. Its legacy is not so much a function of the past, but of how it is contextualized in the present. 



### Historical relevance does not necessarily evolve from the original impact of an event but a subsequent relevance. 

##### Where is history made?

+ Religious leaders
+ Journalists
+ Citizens (dining table)
+ Invested collectivities
+ Movies
+ Museums
+ Non-academic books

Power is the ability of setting that narrative agenda. 
It is the ability to institute silences. 

##### When does silencing occur?

+ Controlling the moment the event occurs
+ Creating (or dismantling) the archives
+ Making up the narrative of the event
+ Controlling the larger historical legacy.

## Recap

1) Human beings participate in history both as actors and narrators. 

2) The distinction between what happened and what is said to have happened is messy.

3) We cannot rely on either positivist or contructivist perspectives to study the past. 

4) Historical relevance does not necessarily evolve from the original impact of an event but a subsequent relevance: The past is a position.

5) Collectivities experience the need to impost a test of credibility on certain events and narratives because it matters to them.

6) Studying the process of the story making is the study of power: power is part of the story, not outside of it.
