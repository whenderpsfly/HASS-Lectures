##### 1) Oral stage

+ Fixation on the mouth
+ Deprived of the breast during weaning leads a child to experience problems.
+ As an adult a person who had issues at this stage could have symptoms like chewing gum or smoking or eating too much, aka satisfaction is obtained through the mouth.
+ Needy people are stuck here.

##### 2) Anal stage

+ Child has problems with toilet training.
+ The child is unwilling to part with their own feces.
+ Adult symptoms include being compulsive, stingy, clean, neat.

##### 3) Phallic stage

+ Fixation on the genitals.
+ Fixation leads to excessive masculinity in females, or dominant characteristics

##### 4) Oedipal complex

+ Occurs in men between 3-4 years old.
+ Male children become aware of and interested in their penis.
+ This fascination is then displaced on an external object. That 'object' is the child's mom.
+ But the father is in the way, so boys want to kill their fathers.
+ Then the boy thinks dad knows and is mad. So they fear being castrated as punishment.
+ Then they don't think about their penis for a long time.

##### 5) Latency stage

+ A period of relative calm, at least in terms of psychosexual development

##### 6) Genital stage

+ Healthy adults are in what Freud calls the 'genital stage'

### The Repressed

+ Once in a while the repressed desires of the Id surface....

#### Defense mechanisms:

+ Sublimation. Sexual or other energy is focused on something else.
+ Displacement. Shameful thoughts or desires are played out as something else.
+ Projection. Impulses that someone is uncomfortable with so they project them to other people.
+ Rationalization. Bad thoughts can be rationalized it as sensible.

##### Method: 

+ Psychoanalysis, **talking**, Freudian slips. Parapraxis.
+ Dreams :thought_balloon:

### Assessing Freud

+ Ideas too vague and are basically always 'right' - They cannot be disproved.

### Freud's Legacy

+ Influential in the humanities and social sciences as a framework for analysis and finding meaning in texts and society.
