[TOC]

### 1. Background

+ Devout Jewish family.
+ Brilliant student
+ Prestigious academic career
+ "Founding father of sociology"
  + France's first course in sociology
  + First sociology journal (1896) ("'Annee Sociologique'")

#### 1.1 Historical context

+ France undergoing industrialization
+ Leads to alienation of people from one another
+ Results in increased political tensions
+ Durkheim's aim was to help French society through scientific analysis of social issues.

### 2. Social structure and Social Change

#### 2.1 Primitive vs. Modern

##### 2.1.1 Primitive

+ People tend to perform similar/multiple functions (clans) and is repeated (across clans) : e.g all men hunt, women cook.
+ **Mechanical Solidarity**: Common set of beliefs, values, and norms unite society. 
+ Very conservative, deviations tend to be punished. (planting on 5th instead of the 10th) Deal poorly with external shocks (foreigners/natural disasters)

**_Change happened_**

##### 2.1.2 Modern

+ People do different things, differentiation occurs, different beliefs

+ Density and Specialization (Darwin's theory): Increase in _population_ density of human interactions, causing humans to start to specialize.
+ Technology

### 3. How does modern society hold together?

#### 3.1 Division of Labor!

+ The function of division of labor is to create social solidarity.

+ **Organic Solidarity**: Specialization creates an interdependent, socially integrated, and unified society. 

+ _Normal people's Society_: Collection of individuals in a specific territory

+ Durkheim's Society: A thing that is already out there, as a unique existence that has an influence over individuals. 

  #### Functionalism. 

+ Modern society is made up of interdependent parts but is greater than the sum of its parts. (Functionalism became 'structural functionalism' after Durkheim)

#### 3.2 Social Facts

* Elements of collective life that exist independently of and are able to exert an influence on individuals.
* Examples: Law. Money. Language. Concert/National Day Parade. (External stuff)
* Compellation: Something out there that compels you to act in a certain manner (constraining force)

+ **How do these come into your consciousness?**
  + Education

**Individual behaviors are not social facts.** E.g suicide, speaking English. It's a refraction of the social norms, just like white light refracts into a rainbow.

+ Methodology: Can be studied scientifically and analysed. 

| Integration(below)/Regulation (right) | Low      | High       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| High                                  | Anomic   | Altruistic |
| Low                                   | Egoistic | Fatalistic |

Start by identifying social facts, then relate them to each other and try to derive.
