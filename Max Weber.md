# Max Weber

The possessor of money becomes a capitalist. ... His aim is rather the unceasing movement of profit-making. - Marx [Capital Vol.1 (in Tucker, page 334)]

[TOC]

## Max Weber's question

+ But then .... why are there capitalists?
  Or more precisely, Why did people begin to aim for "unceasing profit-making" as a goal of their life? Why would they be motivated to do that? Rather than making money in order to buy things (use-values?)

### 1. Weber's methodology of social science

+ Interpretive understanding
+  fully social action

### 2. Weber's theory of modern society and capitalism

Person chopping wood. Motive: Why? (wage? enjoys chopping wood? forced to chop wood? venting frustration?)

+ All (relevant) social action is motivated by subjective meanings.

+ How can we ever understand subjective meanings??

Benefit: if successful, we can achieve something more than natural sciences

Price: Inevitable "hypothetical and fragmentary results" (15)

#### Tool 1: Empathy

#### Tool 2: Ideal type

+ A model that is abstracted from reality, but consistent in terms of logic and meaning.
+ Purposely one-sided emphasis
+ Heuristic, i.e pragmatic and not totalizing
+ Discrepancy between model and historical/sociological data can reveal actual motives.

#### Tool 3: Comparison

+ "the possibility of comparing the largest possible number of historical or contemporary processes which, while otherwise similar, differ in the one decisive point of their relation to the particular motive or factor the role of which is being investigated"(10)

### Two types of social science:

| Durkheim                                  | Weber                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Functionalism or Positivism**           | **Interpretivism**                       |
| Social sciences are like natural sciences | NOT like natural sciences                |
| External observations [e.g statistics]    | interpretive understanding [e.g empathy] |
| Social facts are things                   | Social action is meaningfully motivated  |

#### GREED is NOT the motivation

##### Tool 2: Ideal type: The 'spirit of capitalism'

+ Benjamin Franklin (one of the guys on the notes)
+ A moral duty to capital
  + "Money can beget money, and its offspring beget more, and so on ... He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds."
  + Example: Textile Entrepreneur. Two kinds, Traditional vs Modern
    + Traditional: spends money, at night goes to pub enjoy life (C-M-C)
    + Modern: changing the business, undercutting prices, putting back all the money they make into the industry (M-C-M')

Surprising statistical hints:

1. Business leaders and owners of capital
   + Overwhelmingly Protestant, few Catholics

2. Higher grades of skilled labor
   + Overwhelmingly Protestant, especially the higher technically and whatever trained
3. Districts of highest economic development are Protestant
   + Holland vs Spain

##### Tool 1: Empathy 

Calvinism?

"Calling" = Vocation, mode of employment.

You are "called" to your work in a profession, business, etc.

Asceticism

Using protestants to understand how religion causes people to have duty to earn more money, but not to indulge thus accumulating capital.
